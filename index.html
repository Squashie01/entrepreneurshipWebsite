                    The covid pandemic has disrupted the lives of many people from all walks of life. Restrictions on building capacity, lengthy wait times, social distancing directives, as well as quarantine mandates have opened a window for the introduction of WI DELIVER.

                    WiDeliver falls under a standard business model. On-demand services are not new in the business world today, however, WiDeliver differs from the norm. We give people the ability to order anything from various stores with one delivery. Just as eBay transformed the age-old auctioning process, we are expanding upon and adding value to the way delivery is normally done, giving Barbadians the option to order groceries, clothing, electronics, and more through one service and have them all delivered at once.

                    Wi teleport is a company are hoping to help out the current econmeny from the tragedy of covid -19.  We plan on creating a website that would allow users to allow customers to be able to order, monitor and get a picture of when there product arrives.  We plan on asking business owners regionally to use the sight and put on their products on there, while we hire taxi drivers to pick up the package and deliver it to the customer similarly to uber eats but with a wide virority of stores.

                <h3> Threat of Substitutes </h3>
                <p>
                    We reconised that not a lot of companies can not do dilvery but instead do pickups, where a customer has to go to the business and pick up the product and food in Barbados.  The reason behind this is because it would be to expense to buy cars and pay for gass to deliver island wide.  Wi teleport saw an opportunity in this and thought that we could track taxis, so if a customer wanted items from a particular store, a notification would go to a taxi that is the closes to the store to be able to pick up the items and drop it to the users house, both saving time and gas.

                <h3> Threat of new entrants </h3>
                <p>
                    Wi teleport believe that we can create a system that would be hard to copy by other industries when it comes to locating taxis and cutting cost.  We believe most companies would try to go the traditional rute and try to buy property around the stores and but cars to deliver their goods.

                <h3> Rivalry Among Existing Firms &Barganing Power of Suppliers </h3>
                <p>
                    Wi teleport know that there is a chanse that other companies could create a similar plan where they hire taxi drivers to make delivers.  This is why wi teleport would create a policy where we would try to motivate taxi drivers by creating a loyalty system.  The loyalty system would see how long and how much deliveries you have maid.  Depending on how much they do, they will get bonuses.
